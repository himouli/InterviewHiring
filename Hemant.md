System Design Questions (Technical Depth & Architecture Skills)
Design a Distributed Object Storage System (like S3):

Walk through your approach to ensure high availability, scalability, data consistency, and encryption at rest and in transit.

Design a Secure Key Management System:

How would you architect a multi-tenant system that integrates with 4+ key servers to manage encryption keys securely?

Design a Multi-Cluster Kubernetes Deployment Platform:

Explain how you'd enable rapid deployment and autoscaling across multiple clusters, considering performance and resource constraints.

Design a Metrics Reporting and Alerting System:

Based on your object storage metrics work, describe how you'd architect a system to report size distribution and generate real-time alerts.

Design a Rolling Upgrade Mechanism for a Stateful Service:

What considerations would you take for zero-downtime deployments during software updates in a high-load system?

Design an Event-Driven Data Pipeline using Kafka and Spark:

How would you ingest, process, and store streaming data, ensuring fault tolerance and exactly-once processing?

Design a Legal Hold and Retention Policy Module:

Explain how youâ€™d add governance capabilities into an existing storage system, with strong audit and compliance features.

Design a Resynchronization Protocol for Data Nodes:

Based on your experience, how would you design node state detection and resync logic for consistent data replication?

Design a Resource-Aware Scheduler for a Kubernetes-based Platform:

Describe how you'd build or extend a scheduler to consider CPU/memory constraints and third-party API availability.

Design an Object Versioning and Lifecycle Policy System:

How would you handle versioning, deletion policies, and automatic transitions to cold storage?

ðŸ§  Behavioral Questions (Leadership Principles & Depth)
Ownership
Tell me about a time you owned a critical system or feature end-to-end. What challenges did you face, and how did you overcome them?

Describe a situation where you took responsibility for a failure or bug in production. How did you handle it?

Learn and Be Curious
Youâ€™ve worked in both C++ and Rust. What motivated you to learn Rust, and how did you apply it effectively in a production system?

Tell me about a time you proactively learned a new technology or framework that wasnâ€™t part of your role. Why did you do it, and what was the outcome?

Dive Deep
Explain a situation where you had to dive into a complex system (like Kubernetes or distributed storage) to root-cause a hard problem. What was your debugging process?

Describe a challenging performance issue you encountered and how you diagnosed it at the system/code level.

Bias for Action
Tell me about a time you had to take quick action without having complete data or clarity. What did you do, and what was the result?

Give an example where you had to make a time-sensitive decision with limited input. How did you ensure you were making the right trade-offs?

Invent and Simplify
Can you share a time you simplified a complex process or refactored a system to make it more maintainable?

Tell me about a creative solution you implemented for a problem that initially seemed unsolvabl
