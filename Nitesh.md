Based on the candidate's resume and your objective to assess project experience, system design, and leadership principles ‚Äî particularly Ownership,
Dive Deep, and Learn and Be Curious ‚Äî here's a detailed 60-minute interview schedule with probing questions. This structure allows you to make 
a confident hire/no-hire decision by focusing on depth, clarity, and leadership mindset.

üîç 60-Minute Interview Schedule
‚è±Ô∏è 0‚Äì5 min: Introduction & Context Setting
Welcome the candidate, explain the structure of the interview.

Mention focus areas: project experience, system design, and leadership principles.

‚è±Ô∏è 5‚Äì20 min: Project Experience Deep Dive
Objective: Assess depth of involvement, technical ownership, problem-solving, and cross-functional impact.

Questions:

Pick one project you are most proud of (e.g., Concord ledger system).

What was the problem the team was solving?

What specific part did you design or implement?

Probing:

How did you handle technical debt or legacy code in the project?

What were the biggest trade-offs you had to make?

How did you validate the robustness of the system?

Ownership Check:

Was there a time in the project when you had to step up outside your responsibilities?

How did you handle outages or unexpected production behavior?

‚è±Ô∏è 20‚Äì40 min: System Design Exercise
Objective: Evaluate candidate‚Äôs ability to design scalable, resilient, maintainable systems.

Prompt (example based on background):

‚ÄúDesign a distributed key management system that supports secure storage, retrieval, and rotation of cryptographic keys used across microservices running in containers.‚Äù

Focus Areas to Explore:

High availability and fault tolerance.

Secure bootstrapping and rotation mechanisms.

API design and access control.

Logging and monitoring (tie into Prometheus/Grafana experience).

Trade-offs: centralized vs decentralized, consistency vs latency.

Probing:

What would break at scale?

How would you handle client revocation?

How would you test this system end-to-end?

‚è±Ô∏è 40‚Äì55 min: Leadership Principles Assessment
üî∏ Ownership
Tell me about a time when something went wrong and you took full responsibility.

How did you handle a disagreement or technical pushback from a peer or stakeholder?

üî∏ Dive Deep
Can you walk me through a tough bug you solved end-to-end?

How do you ensure the code you write is maintainable and testable long-term?

üî∏ Learn and Be Curious
What‚Äôs something you learned recently that‚Äôs not directly related to your current job?

Have you ever built something on your own just to explore a new tech?

‚è±Ô∏è 55‚Äì60 min: Wrap-Up
Invite any questions from the candidate.

Provide a brief timeline of next steps.

üìù Evaluation Criteria for Hire/No Hire
Category	Strong Hire	Concerns / No Hire
Project Depth	Demonstrated clear impact & ownership	Superficial understanding; vague contributions
System Design	Structured, scalable, thoughtful design	Lacks structure; misses major considerations
Ownership	Took responsibility, proactive	Blames others, avoids accountability
Dive Deep	Excellent debugging & problem analysis	Shallow understanding
Learn & Be Curious	Self-driven learning, side projects	No growth mindset, fixed routines
