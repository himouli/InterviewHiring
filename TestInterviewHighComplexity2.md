| #  | Question                                   | Ideal Answer Signals                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1  | Design test strategy for async replication | Describes RPO/RTO validation, delayed consistency checks using timestamps/hashes, cross-site latency simulation, comparison tools (e.g., `rsync`, `md5sum`), snapshot point checks        |

| 4  | Consistency in hybrid cloud storage        | Discusses syncing tools (e.g., SnapMirror, AWS Storage Gateway), CAP trade-offs, consistent snapshot orchestration, integrity checks, cloud object versioning                             |
| 5  | Benchmarking virtualized storage           | Describes use of `fio` or `vdbench`, synthetic mixed I/O (read/write, random/sequential), storage cache effects, VMDK disk layout, metrics: IOPS, latency, queue depth                    |
| 6  | Deadlock in orchestration                  | Candidate draws example with multiple subsystem dependencies, identifies lock timing or order issue, uses logs + sequence charts to debug, proposes async orchestration or lock hierarchy |
| 7  | WAL + snapshots + replication              | Understands WAL as write buffer for crash recovery, interaction with snapshot creation (force flush), highlights consistency risks if snapshot timing misaligns with WAL flush            |
| 8  | Debug flaky high-load test                 | Candidate describes logging enhancements, reduction techniques (binary search), environment isolation, use of stress/load tools, timing/debug options (e.g., pytest `--durations`)        |
| 9  | Consistency models in snapshots            | Clearly contrasts strong (synchronous, transactional) vs eventual (delayed, async), DR use case prefers eventual; backup may allow async; for DBs, strong preferred                       |
| 10 | Simulate drive latency/failure             | Mentions Linux tools like `tc` for delay, `dmsetup` for device-mapper layering, `losetup` with custom IO behavior, adds random failures to test RAID handling                             |
| 11 | NFS vs SMB testing differences             | Mentions locking differences (advisory vs mandatory), stateless vs session protocols, caching behavior differences, tests for file contention and cross-platform access                   |
| 12 | HA during rolling upgrade                  | Explains node-by-node upgrade with quorum monitoring, tests for service switchover, use of probe tools (e.g., `cluster status`), verification of non-disruptive ops                       |
| 13 | Test data encryption                       | Validates SSL/TLS using `openssl`, checks headers, uses encrypted data sets for REST APIs, verifies KMS integration, CLI validation via logs and file headers                             |
| 14 | Scale testing 10,000 clients               | Uses tools like `nfs-ganesha`, `fio`, synthetic workloads, resource bottlenecks (inode limits, memory), socket exhaustion, tracks connection success/failure rate                         |
| 15 | Dedup/compression testing                  | Describes verifying post-decompression hashes, edge-case test files (zeroed, similar patterns, encrypted), known data pattern reconstitution, compression ratio thresholds                |
| 16 | Active-active failover validation          | Describes symmetrical traffic flows, intentional failure of controller, no-downtime validation (ping, iostat), metric drop monitoring, session state retention tests                      |
| 17 | Thin provisioning risks                    | Recognizes overcommit danger, describes alert thresholds, simulated full-disk scenarios, test for "out of space" behavior, user warning systems                                           |
| 18 | Filesystem integrity under concurrent ops  | Mentions stress tools (e.g., `fsstress`), testing dirty pages + snapshot races, validating with `fsck`, data loss recovery testing under bursty workloads                                 |
| 19 | Snapshot rollback with live writes         | Ensures quiesce before rollback, compares delta changes, intercepts new writes, validation via pre/post snapshot hash comparison, consistency validation tools                            |
| 20 | Upgrade compatibility testing              | Covers upgrade matrix strategy, persistence validation across versions, rollback plans, sample data migration tests, schema/version drift testing                                         |

### ðŸ“‹ Scoring Criteria (per answer)

| Score | Signal                                                                                    |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **5** | Expert-level, mentions tooling + real-world edge cases + shows deep architectural insight |
| **4** | Solid understanding, covers depth but might miss tooling or test implementation nuance    |
| **3** | General idea correct, but lacks detail or doesnâ€™t relate well to storage systems          |
| **2** | Vague or theoretical, missing real-world relevance or depth                               |
| **1** | Incorrect or completely unrelated to the question                                         |
