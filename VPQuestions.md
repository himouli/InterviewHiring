Here are tough questions on leadership, strategy, roadmap, hiring, and market conditions:

## Leadership & Organizational Direction

**On Leadership Stability:**
- "We've had significant leadership churn at the director/VP level. How should I be thinking about continuity of vision when priorities seem to shift with each new leader?"

**On Decision-Making:**
- "I've seen several strategic decisions get reversed or deprioritized recently. What's driving that, and how can I better anticipate these shifts so my team isn't constantly pivoting?"

**On Your Authority:**
- "What decisions can you actually make versus what needs to go higher up? I want to understand how much runway you have to make changes based on our feedback."

**On Management Philosophy Conflicts:**
- "The messaging from leadership about management style seems inconsistent - some leaders push for autonomy, others want tight control. What's the actual expectation, and how do you see your role in resolving this?"

**On Communication Gaps:**
- "Information seems to flow slowly from executive leadership to our level. What can we do to get better visibility into decisions that affect our teams before they're announced?"

## Strategy & Roadmap

**On Strategic Clarity:**
- "If I asked five different leaders what our top priority is, I'd probably get five different answers. How do you see our actual strategy, and what should I tell my team when they ask what matters most?"

**On Roadmap Credibility:**
- "We've missed our last three quarterly roadmap commitments. Are we being overly optimistic in planning, under-resourced, or is something else going on? How do we restore credibility?"

**On Technical Debt:**
- "We keep saying technical debt is a priority, but every planning cycle it gets deprioritized for features. What would it actually take to get meaningful investment here?"

**On Platform vs. Product:**
- "There's constant tension between platform work and product features. How are you thinking about that balance, and how much input do engineering leaders actually have in that decision?"

**On Customer-Driven Chaos:**
- "We seem to be in reactive mode responding to customer escalations rather than executing our strategy. Is this temporary or the new normal? How do we get back to proactive planning?"

**On Success Metrics:**
- "What does success look like for engineering in the next 12 months? Not just shipping features, but how will you and the executive team actually evaluate whether we've done well?"

## Hiring & Team Building

**On Hiring Bar:**
- "We've rejected a lot of strong candidates recently for not being 'senior enough,' but we're also underwater on delivery. Are we being too picky, or do we genuinely need to hold out for more senior talent?"

**On Headcount Games:**
- "We were promised 5 headcount this quarter, then it became 3, now it might be 1. What's really driving these changes, and should I stop planning around promised headcount?"

**On Diversity Goals:**
- "We keep talking about diversity hiring goals, but I don't see pipeline investment or changes to our process. Are we serious about this, or is it just optics?"

**On Internal Mobility:**
- "I have strong ICs who want to move into management, but we keep hiring external managers instead. What's the thinking there? Are we not investing in internal development?"

**On Retention vs. Hiring:**
- "We're spending a lot on recruiting while losing good people. Have we done the math on whether retention investments would be more cost-effective?"

**On Remote/Hybrid:**
- "What's our actual stance on remote work? The stated policy and the unstated pressure feel different, and it's affecting both recruiting and retention."

## Market Conditions & External Factors

**On Economic Reality:**
- "Leadership keeps saying we're in 'growth mode,' but we're seeing budget cuts and hiring freezes. What's the actual financial situation, and how should I be planning?"

**On Competitive Positioning:**
- "We're losing talent to competitors and struggling to hire. Do we have a realistic view of where we stand in the market, or are we operating on outdated assumptions?"

**On Customer Churn:**
- "I'm hearing about customer churn from sales, but we're still prioritizing new features over stability and performance. What are you seeing, and how does it affect our priorities?"

**On AI/Technology Disruption:**
- "How are we thinking about AI affecting our product and our engineering needs? I'm getting questions from the team about whether we're moving fast enough."

**On Acquisition/Funding Rumors:**
- "There are rumors about [acquisition/funding round/layoffs]. I don't need details, but should I be concerned about team stability? People are asking me directly."

**On Market Share Reality:**
- "The narrative we tell ourselves about market position doesn't match what I'm hearing from customers and prospects. Are we being honest about where we stand?"

## Cross-Cutting "Call It Out" Questions

**On Accountability:**
- "We set goals last quarter that we didn't hit, but I haven't seen any retrospective or change in approach. How do we create actual accountability for delivery?"

**On Morale:**
- "Team morale is the lowest I've seen it. Exit interview data probably shows this too. What's the plan to address it, beyond 'we hear you' messages?"

**On Your Mandate:**
- "What did the CEO/executive team actually hire you to do or fix? Understanding your mandate would help me support you better."

**On Organizational Dysfunction:**
- "We have clear organizational dysfunction around [specific issue]. Everyone sees it, but nothing changes. What's blocking progress, and what would it take to actually fix it?"

**On Trust:**
- "I'm going to be direct - there's a trust gap between engineering leadership and the team right now. What's your plan to rebuild that?"

## How to Deploy These

**Pick Your Battles:**
- Choose 2-3 questions max per conversation
- Select the ones where you genuinely need the answer to do your job
- Don't turn it into an interrogation

**Context Matters:**
- Some questions are better for 1-1s, others for group forums
- Consider whether you're asking for yourself or representing team concerns
- Be clear which hat you're wearing

**Softening Language:**
- "I'm trying to understand..." 
- "Help me make sense of..."
- "I'm hearing concerns from my team about..."
- "I want to support the direction, but I need clarity on..."

**When You Get Non-Answers:**
- "I understand you may not be able to share everything, but..."
- "What can you tell me that would help me lead my team through this?"
- "If you can't answer that, can you help me understand the constraints?"

**Follow-Up Pattern:**
- Ask the question
- Listen fully without interrupting
- Probe once if the answer is vague: "Can you help me understand what that means in practice?"
- Know when to stop pushing

**Protect Yourself:**
- Don't ask questions in a way that could be seen as insubordination
- Frame as trying to help, not criticizing
- Document important answers for your own reference
- If you get concerning answers, start thinking about your own options

**The Ultimate Question:**
If you can only ask one thing:
*"What's the one thing you wish more engineering managers understood about what's really happening at the company level right now?"*

This opens the door for them to be honest without you having to probe specific areas.
