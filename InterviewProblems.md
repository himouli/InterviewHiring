Here are the top challenges to raise with a VP about interview inconsistencies:

## 1. Inconsistent Evaluation Standards

**The Problem:**
"We don't have consistent standards for what 'strong hire' means. One interviewer's 'strong yes' is another's 'maybe.' I've seen candidates rejected after four strong interviews because one person had a bad feeling, and others hired despite multiple concerns because we're desperate to fill the role."

**The Impact:**
- We're making arbitrary decisions that hurt our credibility
- Strong candidates are getting rejected while weaker ones slip through
- It's impossible to defend our hiring decisions or learn from mistakes

**What You Need:**
Clear rubrics for each level, calibration sessions across interviewers, and consistent decision-making frameworks.

## 2. Interviewers Operating Off-Script

**The Problem:**
"Despite having structured interview guides, about half our interviewers go completely off-script. They ask their favorite brain teasers, weird hypotheticals, or just have 'conversations' instead of assessing defined competencies. Then they're surprised when their feedback doesn't align with others."

**The Impact:**
- We're not getting signal on what we actually need to assess
- Candidates have wildly different experiences based on who they get
- We can't compare candidates fairly when they weren't asked the same things

**What You Need:**
Interviewer accountability - if people won't follow the process, they shouldn't be on panels.

## 3. Senior Engineers Who Think They Can "Just Tell"

**The Problem:**
"Some of our most senior engineers refuse to use structured questions because they believe they can 'just tell' if someone is good in a conversation. Their feedback is vague ('didn't vibe with them,' 'seemed junior') and often contradicts data-driven assessments from other interviewers."

**The Impact:**
- We're introducing bias disguised as intuition
- These engineers have disproportionate influence despite poor signal
- We've lost good candidates because of unsubstantiated concerns

**What You Need:**
Expectations that everyone follows the process, regardless of seniority, or they don't interview.

---

## 4. Interview Panel Composition Is Random

**The Problem:**
"Panel composition is basically whoever is available that day. We end up with four backend engineers interviewing a frontend candidate, or all junior people interviewing for a senior role, or nobody who actually understands the domain the person would work in."

**The Impact:**
- We're assessing the wrong things with the wrong people
- Candidates don't get to meet relevant team members
- We make uninformed decisions because the right perspectives weren't in the room

**What You Need:**
Strategic panel composition with required representation by role/level/domain.

---

## 5. "Culture Fit" Is a Black Box

**The Problem:**
"The 'culture fit' or 'values' interview is completely subjective. Different interviewers are testing for different things - some want friendly people, others want debaters, some want passion, others want calm. We've rejected diverse candidates for 'not being a culture fit' in ways that feel problematic."

**The Impact:**
- Culture fit becomes culture clone
- We're potentially introducing illegal bias
- Strong candidates from non-traditional backgrounds get filtered out
- Our team diversity isn't improving

**What You Need:**
Specific, measurable criteria for what culture fit actually means, or eliminate it entirely.

---

## 6. Technical Bar Fluctuates Wildly

**The Problem:**
"Our technical bar seems to depend on headcount pressure. When we're desperate, suddenly candidates who would've been 'no hire' three months ago are 'good enough.' When we're picky, people with years of relevant experience are 'not senior enough.' We're not consistent."

**The Impact:**
- Team quality becomes inconsistent
- Later hires resent that standards dropped for earlier hires
- We lose credibility with the team when obviously weak hires get through

**What You Need:**
Commitment to maintaining the bar regardless of pressure, or honest discussion about adjusting it permanently.

---

## 7. Feedback Is Written After Decision Is Made

**The Problem:**
"I've watched interviewers walk out of interviews saying one thing, then write completely different feedback after hearing others' opinions in the debrief. Or worse, they submit vague bullet points and just go with consensus in the room."

**The Impact:**
- The loudest voice wins, not the best data
- We're not getting independent assessments
- Groupthink leads to poor decisions

**What You Need:**
Required written feedback before the debrief, with consequences for people who don't submit it.

---

## 8. No Calibration Across Teams

**The Problem:**
"Different teams have completely different standards. A 'senior engineer' bar on one team would be 'staff' on another. When we try to do cross-team hiring or internal mobility, we discover we're not even speaking the same language about levels."

**The Impact:**
- Internal equity issues when people discover the inconsistency
- Can't move people across teams effectively
- Compensation becomes arbitrary

**What You Need:**
Company-wide calibration sessions and shared leveling guidelines that everyone actually uses.

---

## 9. Interviewer Training Is a One-Time Checkbox

**The Problem:**
"We do interviewer training once when someone first joins a panel, then never again. People forget the process, develop bad habits, or just weren't good at it in the first place. There's no ongoing development or feedback for interviewers on their effectiveness."

**The Impact:**
- Interview quality degrades over time
- New interviewers learn bad habits from veterans
- We don't know who our best/worst interviewers are

**What You Need:**
Regular refresher training, feedback loops, and performance tracking for interviewers.

---

## 10. Speed Pressure Overrides Quality

**The Problem:**
"When leadership says 'we need to move faster,' it gets interpreted as 'lower the bar.' Fast feedback becomes sloppy feedback. Panel debriefs get rushed. We skip calibration discussions to get offers out. Then we're stuck with bad hires."

**The Impact:**
- Bad hires cost way more than taking an extra week to decide
- Team has to work with people who shouldn't have been hired
- My credibility as a hiring manager suffers

**What You Need:**
Clarity that speed means efficient process, not compromised standards.

---

## Bonus: The Meta-Problem

**The Real Issue:**
"Here's what concerns me most: when I raise these issues, I'm told 'we know, we're working on it,' but nothing changes. These aren't new problems - they've existed for years. At some point, inconsistent interviewing becomes a choice we're making, not a problem we're solving."

**The Question:**
"What would it actually take to fix this? Budget? Executive mandate? Consequences for non-compliance? Because incremental improvements haven't worked, and it's affecting our ability to build a strong team."

## How to Present These

**Don't dump all at once** - pick your top 3-4 based on what's most broken

**Bring data:**
- "In the last 10 hires, we had split decisions 8 times"
- "30% of our interviewers don't submit written feedback"
- "We've had 5 candidates decline specifically citing interview experience"

**Propose solutions, not just problems:**
- "I'd like to pilot required calibration sessions for our team"
- "Can we implement mandatory written feedback before debriefs?"
- "What if we tracked interviewer performance and provided feedback?"

**Frame it as business risk:**
- "Bad hires are expensive - this is costing us"
- "We're losing good candidates to competitors with better processes"
- "This is a diversity and inclusion risk we should take seriously"

**Be ready for pushback:**
- "That's too rigid" → "What's the alternative that maintains quality?"
- "People are too busy" → "Then we're too busy to hire well"
- "It's always been this way" → "And has it been working?"

The key is showing this isn't complaining - it's identifying fixable problems that are hurting the business and your ability to deliver on your hiring goals.
