Here are 10 targeted past-experience and behavioral questions you can use to probe Deependra’s fit across key dimensions:

Deep Dive / Technical Curiosity
“Tell me about a time when you encountered unexpected performance bottlenecks in your Apache Arrow work. How did you investigate, diagnose the root cause, and what steps did you take to resolve it?”

Deliver Results / Impact
“Describe a project—like moving intermediate profile updates to a disk-backed KV store—where you had to hit a hard deadline. What concrete metrics did you track, and how did you ensure you met or exceeded them?”

Ownership / Accountability
“Walk me through a production incident (e.g., out-of-memory in Dremio pods) that you owned end-to-end. What actions did you take under pressure, and what was the final outcome?”

Customer Obsession
“Give an example of when you gathered customer feedback that led you to change or pivot your technical approach. How did you engage stakeholders, and what did you deliver as a result?”

Learn and Be Curious
“Share a time you had to quickly learn a new tool or framework (for example, integrating Rust optimizations for MDCAP). How did you ramp up, and how did that learning translate into project success?”

Invent and Simplify
“Describe an instance where you simplified a complex system (e.g., compaction strategy in your LSM-tree design). What was the complexity you removed, and what measurable benefits did it bring?”

Collaboration / Cross-Team Work
“Tell me about a time you worked closely with product managers, SREs, or QA on a feature rollout. How did you handle conflicting priorities and ensure alignment?”

Resilience / Handling Failure
“Discuss a situation where a design you proposed (e.g., geo-distributed replication) didn’t work as expected in staging or early production. How did you pivot or recover?”

Trade-Offs / Pragmatism
“When designing your scalable metrics pipeline, how did you balance accuracy of p95 calculations against compute cost or latency? What trade-offs did you consciously make?”

Growth Mindset / Feedback
“Tell me about a time you received critical feedback on your work (code review, architecture review, etc.). How did you respond, and what did you change going forward?”
