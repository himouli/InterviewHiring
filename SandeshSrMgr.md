Below is a **60-minute Senior Manager interview plan** designed to evaluate **project experience, outcomes, 3Ps (People, Project, Product), 3Cs (Upward, Downward, Sideways Communication)** using **leadership principles**.
Each section includes **primary questions**, **what a strong STAR answer looks like**, **data/outcome signals**, and **probing questions** to confidently reach a **Hire / No-Hire** decision.

---

## 0–5 mins | Context Setting & Role Alignment

**Objective:** Set expectations, understand scope and seniority fit.

**Question**

* “Briefly walk me through your current role, size of org you lead, and the 1–2 most impactful programs you’ve owned end-to-end.”

**Strong STAR Signals**

* Clear ownership scope (budget, headcount, roadmap)
* Mentions **scale** (users, revenue, systems)
* Focus on **impact**, not just activity

**Red Flags**

* Vague scope (“supported”, “involved in”)
* No measurable outcomes

---

## 5–20 mins | Deep Dive on Projects & Outcomes (Ownership, Deliver Results)

### Core Question

* “Pick one complex project you owned end-to-end. What problem were you solving, and what changed because of your leadership?”

### Expected STAR Answer (What Good Looks Like)

**Situation:**

* Clear business problem (e.g., latency impacting revenue, regulatory risk, customer churn)

**Task:**

* Explicit ownership (decision maker, not coordinator)

**Actions:**

* Trade-offs made
* Data used (metrics, customer signals, cost models)
* Cross-team execution

**Results:**

* Quantified outcomes (%, $, SLA, NPS, cost, time)

### Data-Driven Outcome Examples

* “Reduced incident rate by **42% QoQ**”
* “Delivered **$8M annual cost savings**”
* “Improved release cadence from **monthly to weekly**”

### Probing Questions

* “What metrics did you use to decide this was the right solution?”
* “What would have failed if you weren’t personally involved?”
* “What decision did you make that was unpopular—but correct?”

**Assessment**

* ✅ Hire signal: Owns outcomes, uses data, explains trade-offs
* ❌ No-Hire: Execution without accountability or metrics

## 20–30 mins | 3Ps Deep Dive – People, Project, Product

### People (Hire & Develop, Earn Trust)

**Question**

* “Tell me about a time you turned around a low-performing team or leader.”

**Strong Answer Indicators**

* Coaching over replacing
* Clear success metrics (attrition ↓, engagement ↑, delivery ↑)
* Psychological safety + accountability

**Probe**

* “Who did you personally fail to develop—and why?”

---

### Project (Dive Deep, Bias for Action)

**Question**

* “Describe a project that was behind schedule. What did you cut, change, or escalate?”

**Strong Answer Indicators**

* Ruthless prioritization
* Explicit trade-offs (scope vs time vs quality)
* Risk management with data

**Probe**

* “What did you stop doing?”

---

### Product (Think Big, Customer Obsession)

**Question**

**Strong Answer Indicators**

**Probe**

* “What customer signal changed your roadmap?”

---

## 30–45 mins | 3Cs – Communication Effectiveness

**Question**

* “Tell me about a time you had to disagree with senior leadership.”

**Strong Answer Indicators**

* Data over emotion
* Clear narrative (problem → options → recommendation)
* Willingness to commit after decision

**Probe**

---

---

## 45–55 mins | Leadership Principles in Action (Judgment & Bar-Raiser Check)

**Question**

* “What is the hardest decision you made with incomplete data?”

**Strong Answer Indicators**

* Explicit assumptions
* Risk mitigation
* Learning loop after outcome

**Probe**

* “What signal told you to pivot—or double down?”

---

## 55–60 mins | Reflection & Close

**Question**
