Design a Scalable Audit Logging System for Security Events
🎯 Objective
Support high-volume, immutable, tamper-proof audit trails of:

User logins

Admin actions

Key changes

Flag changes, recovery attempts

🔍 Interview Questions to Probe Candidate Understanding
Category	Questions
System Basics	- What types of events should be logged?
- How do you ensure immutability of logs?
Ingestion Pipeline	- How would you design the ingestion pipeline to handle millions of events per second?
- Would you buffer or batch logs? How?
Storage	- What database/storage system would you use for high-write, low-read systems?
- How would you retain logs per regulatory requirements (e.g., 7 years)?
Querying	- How would an admin query logs by user, action, or time range? What indexing strategy would you use?
Security	- How do you prevent tampering of logs?
- Would you encrypt logs at rest? How would you control access?
Alerting	- How would you integrate alerts on certain log patterns (e.g., repeated failed logins)?
Multi-Tenancy	- How would you isolate logs per organization/admin group?
High Availability	- What happens if the log collector service crashes? How do you prevent loss of logs?

✅ Bonus Evaluation Tips
Ask candidate to sketch or describe data flow from ingestion to querying.

Look for separation of concerns: ingestion, processing, storage, querying.

Probe trade-offs: using Elasticsearch vs. S3, real-time alerting vs. batch analysis.

Test resilience thinking: what happens when Kafka is down? Log collector crash?
