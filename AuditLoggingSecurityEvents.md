✅ Bonus Evaluation Tips
Ask candidate to sketch or describe data flow from ingestion to querying.

Look for separation of concerns: ingestion, processing, storage, querying.

Probe trade-offs: using Elasticsearch vs. S3, real-time alerting vs. batch analysis.

Test resilience thinking: what happens when Kafka is down? Log collector crash?


Below are model answers for each category of questions related to designing a Scalable Audit Logging System for Security Events. These responses reflect production-grade thinking and are what you'd look for in a strong system design candidate.

✅ System Basics
🔹 What types of events should be logged?
Authentication events (login, logout, failed login)

Authorization failures

Admin actions (flag change, user disable)

Account recovery attempts

Changes to user roles or access

API key generation and usage

Audit trail events for compliance

Why it matters: Helps in incident response, compliance, and threat detection.

🔹 How do you ensure immutability of logs?
Use append-only stores like Kafka or object storage (S3/GCS) with versioning.

Enforce no-update, no-delete policies at the application and IAM level.

Use Merkle trees or hash chaining to detect tampering (for critical logs).

Write once, read many (WORM) support via compliant storage like Amazon S3 Object Lock.

🚀 Ingestion Pipeline
🔹 How would you design the ingestion pipeline to handle millions of events per second?
Clients write logs to a local SDK that buffers data.

SDK sends logs to a high-throughput ingestion layer (e.g., Kafka, AWS Kinesis, Google Pub/Sub).

Use partitioning (e.g., by tenant or time) to scale horizontally.

Downstream consumers (e.g., batch writers, alert engines) process logs asynchronously.

🔹 Would you buffer or batch logs? How?
Yes. Buffer at the client and server level.

SDKs use in-memory or local disk buffers to collect logs and batch send every few seconds or N records.

On the server, Kafka consumers batch and write to storage in chunks to reduce IOPS and improve throughput.

🗃️ Storage
🔹 What database/storage system would you use for high-write, low-read systems?
Hot storage: Elasticsearch or ClickHouse for real-time queries (~last 7 days).

Cold storage: S3, GCS, or Azure Blob Storage for compliance-grade archival.

Use log compaction or tiered storage strategies.

🔹 How would you retain logs per regulatory requirements (e.g., 7 years)?
Store logs in immutable, encrypted object stores (e.g., S3 with Object Lock).

Use lifecycle rules to automatically transition logs (e.g., from S3 Standard to Glacier).

Maintain retention metadata per log type and tenant.

🔍 Querying
🔹 How would an admin query logs by user, action, or time range? What indexing strategy would you use?
Use Elasticsearch or ClickHouse with indexes on:

user_id

event_type

timestamp

tenant_id

Optionally support compound indexes (e.g., user_id + timestamp) for common queries.

Expose a secured API or admin UI to submit filtered queries.

🔐 Security
🔹 How do you prevent tampering of logs?
Append-only writes; no update/delete permissions in backend.

Store logs in WORM-compatible storage (e.g., S3 Object Lock).

Digitally sign log batches using HMAC or asymmetric keys.

Periodic integrity checks (hash chaining or hash snapshot comparisons).

🔹 Would you encrypt logs at rest? How would you control access?
Yes, all logs should be encrypted using KMS-managed keys (e.g., AWS KMS, GCP Cloud KMS).

Apply fine-grained IAM roles for access (e.g., only audit team can view logs).

Use service identity and access tokens (OIDC) for components that read/write logs.

🚨 Alerting
🔹 How would you integrate alerts on certain log patterns (e.g., repeated failed logins)?
Log processor (consumer from Kafka) inspects each event.

Use stream processing tools (Apache Flink, Kafka Streams, Spark Structured Streaming) to identify patterns.

Set threshold rules: e.g., 5 failed logins in 10 mins from same IP.

Trigger alerts via webhooks, Slack, PagerDuty, or insert into an alerting DB for dashboard/UI.
