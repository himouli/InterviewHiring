Hereâ€™s a set of **20 high-complexity (advanced-level) storage domain questions** based on the candidateâ€™s background (NetApp, OTV pipelines, API/CLI testing, NAS/DR, CI/CD). These are intended to challenge deep knowledge, architecture-level understanding, edge-case awareness, and decision-making in real-world storage systems.
