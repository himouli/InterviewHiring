In this session we’ll spend the first 15 minutes drilling into the candidate’s test strategy and methodologies, evaluating how they architect end‑to‑end quality
and choose the right approaches for different scenarios 
InterviewBit
. Next, 20 minutes focus on a system‑design‑for‑testability exercise—designing a mini “order processing” system with hooks for observability, fault injection, 
and automated test harnesses—assessing their ability to think at scale and bake in testability from the start 
LinkedIn
. We’ll then allocate 15 minutes to deep‑dive technical questions on specific methodologies (e.g., BDD vs. ATDD, risk‑based testing, performance testing frameworks), 
confirming they can navigate trade‑offs and innovate on process 
LambdaTest
. Finally, 10 minutes of behavioral questions tied to Amazon’s Leadership Principles—Ownership, Dive Deep, Invent & Simplify, Think Big—will surface 
concrete examples of how they’ve driven quality and improvement in prior roles

⏱ Time Allocation
Segment	Duration
1. Test Strategy Deep Dive	15 min
2. System‑Design‑for‑Testability	20 min
3. Test Methodologies & Trade‑offs	15 min
4. Leadership Principles (Behavioral)	10 min

1. Test Strategy Deep Dive (15 min)
Goals
Evaluate how they define scope, risk, and coverage in complex features 
InterviewBit
.

Understand their approach to shifting left, CI/CD integration, and defect prevention.

Sample Questions
Scoping & Risk: “Given a new payments feature that touches front‑end, API, and database, how would you structure your test strategy?”

Shift‑Left Practices: “How have you integrated testing into early sprints? What metrics did you track?”

Coverage & Traceability: “How do you ensure your automated suite truly covers business-critical flows, not just code paths?”

2. System‑Design‑for‑Testability (20 min)
Design Prompt:
“Architect a simple order‑processing microservice system (API gateway, order service, inventory DB). Show how you’d build in testability, observability, and fault‑injection hooks.”

a) High‑Level Architecture (5 min)
Sketch components and data flow. 
LinkedIn

Clarify SLAs, scale targets (e.g., 1 k orders/sec).

b) Testability & Observability (10 min)
Instrumentation: Where do you add health‑check endpoints, structured logging, metrics?

Fault Injection: How to simulate downstream DB outages or high latency?

Test Harness: Outline a harness for end‑to‑end smoke tests, contract tests, and chaos scenarios.

c) Trade‑Offs & Scaling (5 min)
Mock vs. Stub vs. Sandbox: When to use each?

Environment Parity: How do you guarantee staging mimics prod?

3. Test Methodologies & Trade‑Offs (15 min)
Goals
Probe depth on specific testing approaches and their appropriate contexts 
LambdaTest
.

Assess ability to innovate (“Invent & Simplify”) and think big about quality processes.

Sample Topics & Questions
Behavior‑Driven vs. Data‑Driven: “When would you choose BDD (Cucumber) over data‑driven tests?”

Performance Testing: “Describe your experience with load‑testing frameworks (e.g., JMeter, Locust). How do you set SLIs/SLOs?”

Risk‑Based Testing: “How do you prioritize test cases when time is limited? Give a concrete example.”

Test Automation at Scale: “How have you tackled flakiness and maintenance challenges in large suites?”

4. Leadership Principles (Behavioral) (10 min)
Tie questions to key leadership principles and listen for STAR‑style responses.

Ownership
“Tell me about a time you discovered a critical bug in production. How did you take ownership from detection through resolution?” 
About Amazon

Dive Deep
“Describe a situation where surface‑level fixes weren’t enough. How did you root‑cause the issue?” 
amazon.jobs

Invent & Simplify
“Share an example where you invented or automated a process to simplify test workflows.” 
Interview Genie

Think Big
“How have you scaled a testing framework or strategy to support new regions/customers?” 
agile-academy.com

Wrap‑Up & Next Steps (5 min)
Candidate questions.

Explain feedback timeline and any follow‑up rounds.

This plan ensures rigorous evaluation of both technical acumen (strategy, design, methodologies) and leadership mindset (Ownership, Dive Deep, Invent & Simplify, Think Big) for a well‑rounded hiring decision.
