In this session we’ll spend the first 15 minutes drilling into the candidate’s test strategy and methodologies, evaluating how they architect end‑to‑end quality
and choose the right approaches for different scenarios 
InterviewBit
. Next, 20 minutes focus on a system‑design‑for‑testability exercise—designing a mini “order processing” system with hooks for observability, fault injection, 
and automated test harnesses—assessing their ability to think at scale and bake in testability from the start 
LinkedIn
. We’ll then allocate 15 minutes to deep‑dive technical questions on specific methodologies (e.g., BDD vs. ATDD, risk‑based testing, performance testing frameworks), 
confirming they can navigate trade‑offs and innovate on process 
LambdaTest
. Finally, 10 minutes of behavioral questions tied to Amazon’s Leadership Principles—Ownership, Dive Deep, Invent & Simplify, Think Big—will surface 
concrete examples of how they’ve driven quality and improvement in prior roles

Risk‑Based Testing: “How do you prioritize test cases when time is limited? Give a concrete example.”

Test Automation at Scale: “How have you tackled flakiness and maintenance challenges in large suites?”

4. Leadership Principles (Behavioral) (10 min)
Tie questions to key leadership principles and listen for STAR‑style responses.

Ownership
“Tell me about a time you discovered a critical bug in production. How did you take ownership from detection through resolution?” 
About Amazon

Dive Deep
“Describe a situation where surface‑level fixes weren’t enough. How did you root‑cause the issue?” 
amazon.jobs

Invent & Simplify
“Share an example where you invented or automated a process to simplify test workflows.” 
Interview Genie

Think Big
“How have you scaled a testing framework or strategy to support new regions/customers?”

Wrap‑Up & Next Steps (5 min)
Candidate questions.

Explain feedback timeline and any follow‑up rounds.

This plan ensures rigorous evaluation of both technical acumen (strategy, design, methodologies) and leadership mindset (Ownership, Dive Deep, Invent & Simplify, Think Big) for a well‑rounded hiring decision.


Below is a list of 20 top interview questions a hiring manager can use to evaluate a Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET). These span test strategy, automation design, system‐design for testability, performance & tooling, and probe leadership principles like Ownership, Dive Deep, Invent & Simplify, and Think Big.
