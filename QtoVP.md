Here are thoughtful questions an engineering manager might ask a visiting VP, organized by topic:

## Leadership & Management

- How do you think about the balance between delivering short-term results and investing in long-term technical capabilities?
- What do you see as the most important leadership skills for engineering managers at our stage of growth?
- How should we be thinking about developing our team leads into future senior leaders?
- What's your approach to managing up effectively while protecting the team from unnecessary churn?

## Roadmap & Strategy

- What are the top 3-5 strategic bets the company is making over the next 12-18 months, and how does our team's work ladder up to those?
- How do you see our technical priorities shifting as the business evolves?
- Where do you think we're over-investing or under-investing from a product/engineering perspective?
- How should we be thinking about technical debt in relation to feature velocity?

## Organizational Direction

- What capabilities or skills do you think are missing from the engineering organization today?
- How do you see the engineering org structure evolving as we scale?
- What does "good" look like for our team's impact at the company level?

## Hiring & Talent

- What are your priorities for hiring in the next quarter - seniority levels, specializations, or gaps we should focus on?
- How should we be thinking about the bar for hiring given market conditions?
- What retention risks are you most concerned about across engineering?

## Market & External Factors

- What competitive or market dynamics are you most focused on right now?
- How are economic conditions affecting our hiring plans and budget for the year?
- Are there emerging technologies or industry trends you think we should be paying more attention to?

These questions show strategic thinking while helping you understand context that affects your team directly.
