Would you like a written template to record notes during this interview or a feedback form for interview loop sharing?


Absolutely. Below are **interview-style answers** to all 20 questions designed to reflect how a strong candidate like Prateek Garg (based on his resume) might respond. These answers are also **structured in a way suitable for verbal delivery during an interview** ‚Äî clear, concise, and technically detailed.

---

### ‚úÖ **Section 1: Distributed Systems Fundamentals**

**1. How does YARN differ from traditional monolithic schedulers?**
YARN decouples resource management (ResourceManager) from application logic (ApplicationMaster), allowing it to scale across frameworks. Unlike monolithic schedulers, it supports multiple tenants and workloads using a pluggable scheduling policy.

**2. How does the ResourceManager handle failover?**
It uses Zookeeper to manage active-standby transitions. The active RM persists state like app/AM metadata in a durable store. On failover, the standby rehydrates state and continues scheduling with minimal disruption.

**3. What is the CAP theorem, and how does it affect design?**
CAP states you can only pick two of Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance. For resource schedulers, we favor **Availability + Partition Tolerance**, while maintaining eventual consistency on usage state.

**4. How does Raft ensure log replication?**
Raft elects a leader who appends to logs and replicates them to followers. A log entry is considered committed when it's stored on a majority. It handles leader failures via heartbeats and re-election.

**5. How do you ensure consistency and durability in job metadata?**
We persist job metadata in a fault-tolerant store (e.g., RocksDB or RDBMS with WAL), and sync it periodically. Write-ahead logging ensures that even if the RM crashes, we can replay logs and restore state.

---

### ‚úÖ **Section 2: Scheduling & Resource Optimization**

**6. How was NUMA-aware scheduling implemented?**
We extended the YARN scheduler to be NUMA-aware by grouping CPU cores by NUMA node and selecting placement strategies like local bin-packing to reduce memory access latency, improving performance for memory-bound jobs.

**7. Compare bin-packing vs spreading.**
Bin-packing consolidates jobs to reduce fragmentation and cost. Spreading avoids hotspots by distributing load. In our case, we used bin-packing for batch jobs and spreading for long-running services.

**8. How does the telemetry loop influence scheduling?**
Node telemetry (disk usage, CPU saturation) is streamed to the RM. We implemented a dynamic feedback loop where the scheduler deprioritizes nodes with unhealthy disk/CPU metrics in real time.

**9. How do you mitigate disk hotspotting?**
We added disk-awareness to the scheduler so it considers per-disk IOPS and occupancy. Jobs are scheduled on nodes with low disk pressure, and we also avoid colocating I/O-heavy jobs on the same node.

**10. How do you balance preemption?**
We preempt jobs when higher-priority jobs are starved, but only after evaluating job setup cost and preemption penalty. For example, we avoid preempting large Spark jobs unless absolutely necessary.

---

### ‚úÖ **Section 3: Security, Isolation & Multi-Tenancy**

**11. What were the challenges in implementing Low-Privilege Containers?**
One key challenge was preserving job functionality while restricting privileges. We had to simulate an almost-native environment while enforcing guards on filesystem, registry, and network access using AppContainer APIs.

**12. How do AppContainers differ from cgroups or Docker?**
AppContainers are Windows-native and offer fine-grained isolation without requiring a daemon. Unlike Docker, they don't require container images. They're lighter but less portable. We used them for native process containment.

**13. How do you design tenant-level access control?**
Each tenant gets a logical queue with ACLs. At runtime, containers are launched with tenant-specific permissions (UID/GID or Windows token). We also enforce network firewalls and storage quotas at the node level.

**14. What telemetry/audit logs do you use for security?**
We log container launches, privileged access attempts, process execution, and network connections. This allows forensic analysis in case of breach or misbehavior. Logs are streamed to a SIEM tool like Azure Sentinel.

---

### ‚úÖ **Section 4: Data Engineering & Storage**

**15. How did you ensure consistency in Solr partial updates?**
We used Solr‚Äôs atomic update semantics and a lock-less design. Updates were staged and committed using versioning logic, and validation ensured that stale updates didn‚Äôt override newer indexed documents.

**16. Which Hive optimizations gave the best performance?**
Columnar formats like ORC with vectorization provided major gains. Other wins came from join ordering based on stats, broadcast joins for small tables, and bucketing to reduce shuffles.

**17. How do you handle join skew?**
We used map-side salting: we duplicated skewed keys with suffixes to distribute them across reducers, then deduplicated post-join. Also, we persisted intermediate results to avoid recomputation in case of failure.

---

### ‚úÖ **Section 5: System Design & Production Readiness**

**18. How would you design for burst workloads + SLAs?**
I‚Äôd use auto-scaling for queue capacity with reservation logic for priority jobs. Bursty tenants get temporary boosts, but low-latency tenants have protected headroom. Also, dynamic weight scaling in fair scheduler helps.

**19. How would you instrument and alert on resource starvation?**
Each job queue has SLA metrics like pending time and success ratio. We alert when jobs are pending > threshold or usage < guaranteed capacity, indicating contention or misconfiguration.

**20. How do you scale the ResourceManager?**
We can shard RM functionality (e.g., separate scheduler and app state manager) and persist state externally. For massive scale, consider federated RMs or split scheduling responsibilities based on queue/region.

### üîÅ **How to Deliver These Answers in Interview Style**

Here‚Äôs how the candidate can deliver confidently:

* **Structure**: Start with a 1-sentence summary ‚Üí then go 2‚Äì3 levels deeper ‚Üí finish with an example.
* **Tie to experience**: Wherever possible, say *‚ÄúIn my previous project at Microsoft, we handled this by‚Ä¶‚Äù*
* **Be honest**: If unsure, say, *‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt worked directly on X, but I‚Äôd approach it by‚Ä¶‚Äù*
* **Watch time**: Keep answers between **2‚Äì3 minutes**, unless prompted to go deeper.
